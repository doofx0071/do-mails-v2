## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a privacy-conscious individual, I want to create and manage multiple email aliases under my own custom domains so that I can compartmentalize my email communications, protect my real email address from exposure, and maintain organized inboxes for different purposes while being able to respond from the appropriate alias identity.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Domain Management
1. **Given** I own a custom domain, **When** I add it to the system, **Then** I receive DNS verification instructions
2. **Given** I have completed DNS verification, **When** the system checks my domain, **Then** my domain status shows as verified and available for alias creation
3. **Given** I have multiple domains, **When** I view my domain list, **Then** I can see the verification status of each domain clearly

#### Email Alias Creation and Management
4. **Given** I have a verified domain, **When** I create a new email alias, **Then** the alias is immediately available to receive emails
5. **Given** I want a random alias name, **When** I use automatic generation, **Then** the system creates a unique alias name for my domain
6. **Given** I have created aliases, **When** I view my alias list, **Then** I can see when each alias last received an email and toggle them on/off

#### Unified Inbox Experience
7. **Given** emails are sent to my various aliases, **When** I open my inbox, **Then** all emails appear in a single unified view showing which alias received each email
8. **Given** I receive multiple emails in a conversation, **When** I view them, **Then** they are grouped into threaded conversations like Gmail
9. **Given** I want to organize my emails, **When** I use labels or folders, **Then** I can categorize and filter emails effectively

#### Email Composition and Privacy
10. **Given** I receive an email at an alias, **When** I reply to that email, **Then** my response is sent FROM the alias address, not my real email
11. **Given** I want to compose a new email, **When** I select an alias to send from, **Then** the recipient sees the email as coming from that alias
12. **Given** I have multiple aliases, **When** I set up email signatures, **Then** I can configure different signatures for each alias

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a domain verification fails or expires?
- How does the system handle emails sent to disabled aliases?
- What occurs when a user tries to reply from an alias that has been disabled?
- How are email attachments handled securely across different aliases?
- What happens when multiple users accidentally try to verify the same domain?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Domain Management
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to add custom domains to their account
- **FR-002**: System MUST verify domain ownership through DNS TXT record verification before allowing alias creation
- **FR-003**: System MUST display clear verification status for each domain (pending, verified, failed)
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to add multiple domains to their account
